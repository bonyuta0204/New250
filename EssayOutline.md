## Struggling for effectiveness and canadian foreign aid by  Stephen Brown
###Introduction

two key themes in depelopmental assistance

+ Aid effectiveness 
+ Policy Coherence

#### Aid effectiveness
+ it is hard to asses the effectiveness of aid. 
it is not easily measured by numbers, and the output depends on enviroment.
+ donor's actual objectives for providing ODA relates 
more to thier own interest, though the extent is not clear
+ actually, those institution acknowledy admit that thier motivation is self-interest
+ since, many aid are given for the sake of donors, it is natural that developmental effectiveness are not persued
and thus it is not effective.


#### Policy Coherence

+ The principle : a government’s departments should not or at cross-purposes
+   Canadian  government’s instances of policy coherence tend to undermine development rather than promote it, 
though chapter 4 provides a couple of contrasting eamples

more and more aid are give to middle-class contries such as Vietnum, Peru 
Canadian Government have never commited to an increase of ODA.
Canada sticks to bilateral aid despite the evidence that untieing bilateral aid leads to effectiveness.

## Changing Perception into Reality: Canada in Africa by David J Hornsby
Canada was trying to be perceived as good internationalist citizen. But this is disconnected from reallity.
now canada is more focus on military, less aid and more concentration to non-African country.
Canada's non-imperialist international approach is well situated with current situation in Africa.

This Paper focused on three perspective.

1. Economic
2. Developmental
3. Trans-Social

Trans-Social pillar concerns with migration links.
### The Economic Pillar ; Canada-Africa Trade and Investment
Competition in African Market is Heating up.  
Canada - African Trade occupies only little part of trade in both countries.
Because, commoidies Canada buy from Afrca such as gold, oil, uranium and so on has strong impact on growth, trade relationshp has strong potential for growth.

Althogh, due to the political weekness, canada has yet to done anything with trade with Africa. (e,g, no free trade agreement,)
Political Activity is critical for building trade relationship between Canada and Africa. Canadian Trade in Sub-Sahara is significantly week.This is only solved by political effort.
