## Struggling for effectiveness and Canadian foreign aid by Stephen Brown
###Introduction

Two key themes in developmental assistance

+ Aid effectiveness 
+ Policy Coherence

#### Aid effectiveness
+ It is hard to assess the effectiveness of aid. 
	It is not easily measured by numbers, and the output depends on environment.
+ donor's actual objectives for providing ODA relates 
	More to their own interest, though the extent is not clear
+ Actually, those institution acknowledge admit that their motivation is self-interest
+ Since, many aid are given for the sake of donors, it is natural that developmental effectiveness are not pursued
	and thus it is not effective.


#### Policy Coherence

+ The principle: a government‚Äôs departments should not or at cross-purposes
+   Canadian government‚Äôs instances of policy coherence tend to undermine development rather than promote it, 
	though chapter 4 provides a couple of contrasting examples

### Canada among Donors: How does Canadian Aid Compare?

In this chapter, Canada are compared with other countries in terms of performance as a donor
As a result, authors suggest that Canada's aid especially quality is poorer compared to other nations.  

Canada lucks clear objective when it comes to aid. whereas U.K. or Ireland have clear objective. This leads to anbiguarity as to why Canada seeks for poverty reduction and this follows to luck of self-assesment.

#### Aid Strategy
Canada scored low in CGD ranking in climate change and aid strategy.
Canadian Government lucks big pitcture of aid.It seems like it has no focus nor critical objectives.

Even though Parliament adopted an article which streess the importance of poverty reduction, debate about that topic was never happned in Parliament.
#### Volume of Aid by Canada
fourteenth out of twenty-four countries.  
More and more aid are give to middle-class contries such as Vietnum, Peru 
Canadian Government have never committed to an increase of ODA.
Canada sticks to bilateral aid despite the evidence that untying bilateral aid leads to effectiveness.
Canada was once dominant at the aid of gender equality but it is now taken place by U.K. and Ireland.
Despite strong economic growth, Canadian government have never committed to an explicit ODA growth linked to the international 0, 7 percent ODA/GNA target.

Non-aid policies can be shaped to be more supportive of the developmental prospects of partner countries.

## Changing Perception into Reality: Canada in Africa by David J Hornsby
Canada was trying to be perceived as good internationalist citizen. But this is disconnected from reality.
Now Canada is more focus on military, less aid and more concentration to non-African country.
Canada's non-imperialist international approach is well situated with current situation in Africa.

This Paper focused on three perspective.

1. Economic
2. Developmental
3. Trans-Social

Trans-Social pillar concerns with migration links.
### The Economic Pillar; Canada-Africa Trade and Investment
Competition in African Market is heating up.  
Canada - African Trade occupies only little part of trade in both countries.
Because, commodities Canada buy from Africa such as gold, oil, uranium and so on has strong impact on growth, trade relationship has strong potential for growth.

Many African states are trying to improve conditions for FDI.

Despite steadily improving figures, this still amounts to little when compared both with other Canadian trade relationships and with other trade partners for Africa. For example, Canadian yearly goods trade with Africa is equivalent to two weeks of Canada? US trade.
In 2009 Canada? Africa goods trade accounted for 1.4 percent of AfricaÅfs market.

Although, due to the political weakness, Canada has yet to done anything with trade with Africa. (e.g., no free trade agreement,)
Political Activity is critical for building trade relationship between Canada and Africa. Canadian Trade in Sub-Sahara is significantly week. This is only solved by political effort.

Sub-Saharan Africa is the most obvious example, receiving the smallest share of Canadian exports: just 0.4 percent.25 these low numbers are not likely to change without Canadian political representatives pushing trade links and countering misinform- tion about the investment environment. There
##### Investment to Africa
In 2012 only approximately $4 billion out of the $711 billion went to African countries.

Canada is trying to make more FIPA with African States and adopted some FIPA with African nations. But none of them are in force and studies show that FIPA which is not in force is useless.

Canada does nice job in area of mining. Canada put focus on mining in Africa and making profit for both Canadian Companies and development in target countries. But there is also critique for this in terms of security of exploitation. There is also other areas that Canada can invest (e.g. financial institution, insurance company etc.).

Canada has to broaden the scope of its economic engagement if it aims to do play more important role in Africa.

### The developmental pillar: Canadian aid in Africa
Canadian aid has been very inconsistent.  
Canadian aid for Africa was a lot in 2010, but it starts to declining and now that Canada support only small part of countries in the Continent.
The reason for this, by government, is to make effective support for developing countries. However, effectiveness is very difficult to measure.
**Canada has to ask question of purpose and desired outcome of developmental support. **
Canada has been focused on short-term initiative and accountability rather than long-term vision. 
The fact that Canadian government has never undertaken "big picture" review of aid support this view. On the Contrary, Canadian aid has been always reshaped by the wished and desires of the prime minister in that time. 

Integration of ministries may do well for making coherence aid. However there is a chance that it can do harm due to intradepartmental politics and so on.

### The trans-societal pillar: the bridge between Canada and Africa.
Canada make no effort to engage with diaspora (immigrants from Africa) and government has no guideline for doing so.
Immigrants can put pressure both their host and home government. And they are also important because they sent money (remittances) to their home country. 
Canada should make use of immigrants if it wants to engage more efficiently and effectively with Africa. It should make use of a source that is readily available and accessible.

## Canadian Foreign Policy and Africa's Diaspora: Slippery Slope or Opportunity Unrealized? By David Carment et al.
Canada has no activities engaging with African Diasporas. Engaging with Diasporas may have a good effect to politics, but there is chance that new Canadian bring their home ground issue to Canada. This chapter discusses potential of Diasporas.

Diasporas can stimulate trade, also, they can give an aid by remittances. And Diasporas utilize host countries freedom to lobby for political aim which does not necessarily conflict with host countries. 

Canada has to set ground rules for diaspora lobbying or for engaging diaspora in their host states. (No rules in current situation.)  

#### Role of Policy
Whether or not Diasporas are effective for development in their home country and peace is largely depend on policy of the home country. 
When the policies accept Diasporas to invest on important sector of their country, Diasporas tend to have good effect on home country
By lowering the transaction fee, diaspora can stimulate trade between host and home countries.
Banking and investment sector are important for overcoming obstacles for transfer.

#### The African context
Diasporas give important insight to conflict and people involved to that. They also encourage trust and interdependence between two conflicting group and international organizations. (Hall and Swain2007)

Many African Diasporas to face politically and economically involved with their homeland whereas living their life in host country.

#### Canada as country of immigrant
African-Canadian population is Canada's fastest growing ethnic minority.  
The third largest minority group in Canada.
### Example of Somalia
Diaspora from Somalia contribute to their country a lot. But, they tend to unemployed due to discrimination, barrier of language and so on.
This leads to possibilities that unemployed Somali Diasporas go back to terrorists or gang.
### Conclusion
However, large number of emigration may lead to 'Brain Drain' of host country.

## Beyond Remittances: The Role of Diaspora in Poverty Reduction in their Countries of Origin
### Brief Summary of this paper
This paper examines the role of Diaspora in poverty reduction through four main areas of focus, as requested by DFID:

+ Policy and practice towards Diaspora on the part of countries of origin
+ Diaspora engagement in countries of origin (in the economic, social and political spheres), including the networks and infrastructure in which it is manifested
+ Donor engagement with Diaspora
+ Recommendations for future activity by DFID to maximize the contribution of Diaspora to development and poverty reduction

	The first is that DFID and other donors invest heavily in a stronger knowledge base for policy making through research, analysis and rigorous evaluation of Diaspora involvement in development and its impact on poverty.**For the donor country**, this paper suggest that **it should promote the effectiveness of diasporas by policy intervene.**
	>offered by G. Scheffer: ÅgModern Diasporas are ethnic minority groups of migrant origins residing and acting in host countries but maintaining strong sentimental and material links with their countries of origin? Their homelands.Åh  


Diaspora based development efforts are powerful development resource but they are not a substitute for donor resources.

Strength of both Diaspora and International organization can be magnified through effective collaboration.
### Power of Diasporas
#### Power of Remittances
Remittance has strong effect too poverty reduction because it tends to flow directly to household and used for basic needs as food, shelter, healthcare
diasporas is major source of FDI, market development (including outsourcing of production), technology transfer, philanthropy, tourism, political contributions, and more intangible flows of knowledge, new attitudes, and cultural influence.

But quality in these dimension are has not studied yet enough.
### Diaspora Engagement in countries of origin
The most direct and immediate impact on poverty comes out of Diaspora engagement at family and community level.  
#### Example of bussiness
Example of African Diaspora Summit conducted in Holland. 
The participants were acutely aware of the need for skills and resources in Africa to accomplish self-reliant development and the ability of Africans in the Diaspora to provide such skills and resources,

Example of GHNA expo(bussiness exhision for Ghana diaspora, supported by Ghana government)

Significant investment in the country of origin by Diaspora investors can be a push factor for market reforms and/or strengthening institutions in country of origin. Again,

Indian diasporas example: diasporas of inida has power to put pressure on the government that they will stop investing unless the corruption is improved. this has large impact on government and contributed to lessen corruption.

microfinance fund start to rely on diasporas as source of funding.
#### social capital
>Peggy Levitt defines Ågsocial remittancesÅh as Ågthe ideas, behaviours, identities and social capital that flow from receiving country to sending country communities.Åh56

#### Moderating conflict
Diasporas may have a wider and more objective perspective, less influenced by raw emotion and anger. In their new homeland, the may have access to a wider variety of information sources, such as those provided by social and employment contacts, media reporting and internet communications.Åh70

Diaspora involvement in political changes may help to avert violent conflict by promoting and funding non-violent forms of opposition.

#### Philanthropy(Voluntality)
range from small as indivisual to powerful networks

#### Conclusion 

Their contacts and ties in the home country give them access to information about business opportunities, the ability to identify reliable partners, and resources to enforce contracts even in settings where civil law enforcement is weak.79
The challenge for donors is to identify organizations that have both the capacity and the interest to work with poor communities.

### Engagiment by Donor

+ Lowering transaction costs 
+ Improving data collection 
+ Extending the availability of financial services, especially to poor people and rural areas 
+ Encouraging collective remittances to support community development and employment generation
+ Sponsoring research on the patterns and uses of remittances

Several donors have taking action such as lowering Trans supporting services and opportunities that will enable remitters and receivers of remittances to achieve and expand their goals for these transfers.

Some donor agencies, such as the U.S. Inter-American Foundation, support the efforts of Diaspora groups to do community development work in their countries of origin.
The volume of policy literature, extremely limited before the late 1990s, is growing fast with support from multilateral and national donor agencies.
The governments of Denmark, the United Kingdom (through DFID and the Economic and Social Research Council), Sweden and the United States, as well as IOM, ILO, the World Bank and the IADB, have been particularly active in commissioning studies, organizing conferences with important background papers, an
honor governments and institutions, including private foundations, have taken some modest steps to enhance the capacity of Diaspora communities to contribute to development and the reduction of poverty in countries of origin, but much more could be done.(e.g. French government, U.S.)

The long-standing engagement of Diaspora communities in their countries and communities of
origin produces enormous financial flows and significant ÅgflowsÅh of human capital, technology, and political support.
### Recomendation for Donnor
In addition to financial flows, Diasporas have impacts on political development, policy reforms, social attitudes, foreign relations, conflict resolution (or perpetuation), technology transfer, cultural preservation, leadership development and philanthropy ? among other things

The safest approach for donors such as DFID is to support the extension
of already-successful initiatives to a larger scale or to other locations,

Donors should consider providing seed money, technological assistance and logistical
support to build and strengthen Diaspora networks that have a strong developmental potential, such as those devoted to cooperation in business or information technology.

Donor governments should intervene to stop fundraising in the Diaspora for support of destructive communal conflicts, possibly using the mechanisms of the G7 Action Plan within the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF).101
