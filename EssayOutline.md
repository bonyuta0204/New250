## Struggling for effectiveness and Canadian foreign aid by  Stephen Brown
###Introduction

two key themes in depelopmental assistance

+ Aid effectiveness 
+ Policy Coherence

#### Aid effectiveness
+ it is hard to asses the effectiveness of aid. 
it is not easily measured by numbers, and the output depends on enviroment.
+ donor's actual objectives for providing ODA relates 
more to their own interest, though the extent is not clear
+ actually, those institution acknowledy admit that their motivation is self-interest
+ since, many aid are given for the sake of donors, it is natural that developmental effectiveness are not persued
and thus it is not effective.


#### Policy Coherence

+ The principle : a government’s departments should not or at cross-purposes
+   Canadian  government’s instances of policy coherence tend to undermine development rather than promote it, 
though chapter 4 provides a couple of contrasting eamples

### Canada Among Donors: How does Canadian Aid Compare?

  In this chapter, Canada are compared with other countreis in terms of performance as a donor
as a result, authors suggest that Canada's aid especially quolity is poorer compared to other nations.  

Canada lucks clear objective when it comes to aid. whereas U.k. or Ireland have clear objective.This leads to anbiguarity as to why Canada seeks for poverty reduction and this follows to luck of self-assesment.

#### Aid Strategy
Canada scored low in CGD ranking in climate change and aid strategy.
Canadian Government lucks big pitcture of aid.It seems like it has no focus nor critical objectives.

Even though Parliament adopted an article which streess the importance of poverty reduction, debate about that topic was never happned in Parliament.
#### Volume of Aid by Canada
fourteenth out of twenty-four countries.  
more and more aid are give to middle-class contries such as Vietnum, Peru 
Canadian Government have never commited to an increase of ODA.
Canada sticks to bilateral aid despite the evidence that untieing bilateral aid leads to effectiveness.
Canada was once dorminant at the aid of gendaer equality but it is now taken place by U.K. and Ireland.

non-aid policies can be shaped to be more suportive of the developmental prospects of partner countries.

## Changing Perception into Reality: Canada in Africa by David J Hornsby
Canada was trying to be perceived as good internationalist citizen. But this is disconnected from reality.
now Canada is more focus on military, less aid and more concentration to non-African country.
Canada's non-imperialist international approach is well situated with current situation in Africa.

This Paper focused on three perspective.

1. Economic
2. Developmental
3. Trans-Social

Trans-Social pillar concerns with migration links.
### The Economic Pillar ; Canada-Africa Trade and Investment
Competition in African Market is Heating up.  
Canada - African Trade occupies only little part of trade in both countries.
Because, commoidies Canada buy from Afrca such as gold, oil, uranium and so on has strong impact on growth, trade relationshp has strong potential for growth.

Althogh, due to the political weekness, Canada has yet to done anything with trade with Africa. (e,g, no free trade agreement,)
Political Activity is critical for building trade relationship between Canada and Africa. Canadian Trade in Sub-Sahara is significantly week.This is only solved by political effort.

Canada is trying to make more FIPA with African States and adopted some FIPA with African nations. But none of them are in force and studies show that FIPA which is not in force is useless.

Canada does nice job in area of mining. Canada put focus on mining in Africa and making profit for both Canadian Companies and develpment in target countries. But there is also critique for this in terms of security of exploitation. There is also other areas that Canda can invest(e.g. financial instituion, insurance comapany etc.).

Canada has to broaden the scope of its economic engagement if it aims to do play more important role in Africa.

### The developmental pillar: Canadian aid in Africa
Canadian aid has been very inconsistant.  
Canadian aid for Africa was a lot in 2010, but it starts to declining and now that Canada support only small part of countries in the Continent.
The reason for this, by government, is to make effective support for developing countries. however, effectiveness is very difficult to measure.
**Canada has to ask question of purpose and desired outcome of developmental support.**
Canada has been focused on short-term initiative and accountability rather than long-term vision. 
The fact that Canadian government has never undertaken "big picture" review of aid support this view. On the Contrary, Canadian aid has been always reshaped by the wished and desires of the primminister in that time. 

Integration of ministries may do good for making coherence aid. How ever there is a chance that it can do harm due to intradepartmental politics and so on.

### The trans-societal pillar: the bridge between Canada and Africa.
Canada make no effort to engage with diaspora(immigrants from Africa) and government has no guideline for doing so.
Immigrants can put pressure both their host and home government. And they are also important because they sent money(remittances) to their home country. 
Canada should make use of immigrants if it wants to engage more efficiently and effectively with Africa. It should make use of a source that is readily available and accessible.

## Canadian Foreign Policy and Africa's Diaspora: Slippery Slope or Opportunity Unrealized? by David Carment et al.
Canada has no activities engaging with African Diasporas. Engaging with diasporas may have a good effect to politics, but there is chance that new Canadian bring their homeground issue to Canada. This chapter discusses potential of diasporas.

whether or not diasporas are effective for development in  their home country and peace is largely depend on policy of the home country. 
When the policies accept diasporas to invest on important sector of their country, diasporas tend to have good effect on home country

Diasporas can stimulate trade, also, they can give an aid by remittances. And Diasporas utilize host countries freedom to lobby for political aim which does not necessarily conflict with host countries. 
### Example of somalia
diaspora from somalia contribute to their country a lot. But, they tend to unemployed due to discrimination, barrier of language and so on.
This leads to possibilities that unemployed Somali diasporas go back to terrorists or gang.
### Conclusion
However,large number of emigration may lead to 'Brain Drain' of host country.

## Beyond Remittances: The Role of Diaspora in Poverty Reduction in their Countries of Origin
The first is that DFID and other donors invest heavily in a stronger knowledge base for policy making through research, analysis and rigorous evaluation of Diaspora involvement in development and its impact on poverty.For the donor country, this paper suggest that it should promote the effectiveness of diasporas by policy intervene.
